        ### Task: Generate an word overview of this product: ${keyWord} for a section titled: ${sectionHeader}.
        * Length: Strive to write 500-1000 words.
        * Style: Write in a clear, concise, and engaging style.
        * Flow: Natural flow, avoiding repetitive phrases and sentence structure.
        * Structure: Structure your section in the following way:
          - Overview of product

          - Con's List 
          - Closing thoughts on product

        ### Additional Notes on Instructions:
        * You can use the reviews to shape the paragraph, but do not specifically mention that it was a review that your opinion came from.  ENSURE YOU DO NOT REFERENCE THE REVIEW DIRECTLY.  As in stating something like "After reading this review here's a con about the product" 
        * Make sure your opening sentence to the section is unique and doesn't just reiterate the primary keyword.  Avoid using closing statements at the end of the section.

        Analyze the provided example article(s) and create a detailed set of instructions for others to follow to imitate the author's writing style. Your analysis should focus on paragraph structure, sentence structure, word choice, tone, voice, and formatting. Include the following elements in your instructions:

        1. Paragraph Structure:
          - Explain how to vary paragraph length for dynamic flow and readability.
          - Provide guidance on crafting strong, attention-grabbing opening sentences.
          - Discuss the use of transitions between paragraphs to maintain coherence.

        2. Sentence Structure:
          - Advise on using a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences for varied rhythm.
          - Demonstrate how to use short, declarative sentences for impact and emphasis.
          - Encourage the use of descriptive sentences with multiple clauses and adjectives.
          - Explain the effect of occasional sentence fragments and rhetorical questions.

        3. Word Choice:
          - Suggest ways to blend casual and formal language for a conversational yet authoritative tone.
          - Emphasize the importance of vivid adjectives, adverbs, and figurative language.
          - Encourage the use of specific, concrete nouns for authenticity.
          - Provide examples of humor, wit, and clever word play from the example article.

        4. Tone and Voice:
          - Advise on maintaining a conversational, engaging tone that speaks directly to the reader.
          - Stress the importance of injecting passion and enthusiasm into the writing.
          - Encourage the use of self-deprecating humor and honest reflections for relatability.
          - Suggest incorporating pop culture references, historical events, and personal experiences for context and engagement.

        5. Formatting:
          - Explain how to use italics for emphasis, quotes, or internal thoughts.
          - Encourage the use of short, one-line paragraphs for dramatic effect or highlighting quotes.
          - Advise on using em dashes to insert additional thoughts or details within sentences.

        Best practices:
        1. Provide specific examples from the example article to illustrate each point in your instructions.
        2. Encourage the AI model to find a balance between detailed instructions and concise explanations to maintain reader engagement.
        3. Advise the AI model to emphasize the importance of personal anecdotes, humor, and pop culture references in creating a strong connection with the reader.
        4. Remind the AI model to stress the significance of maintaining a conversational tone while still delivering informative and engaging content.
        5. Encourage the AI model to recommend experimenting with different techniques and finding a unique voice that resonates with the reader.
