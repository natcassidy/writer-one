<h2>MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+IN Overview</h2>
<p>After testing the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+IN, we found it to be a 
    reliable and versatile network switch. It comes with eight 
    Gigabit Ethernet ports and two SFP+ ports, which allow for 
    high-speed connections between devices. The CRS310-8G+2S+IN is 
    easy to set up and manage, thanks to the user-friendly web 
    interface. We also appreciate the compact design, which makes 
    it ideal for small office or home environments.</p>
    <!-- 
        FIXME: the 8x gigabit ethernet ports bit is a mistake. those are 2.5gbps ports, not 1gbps

        TODO: inappropriately non-technical for the subject matter. 
        some kind of autodetection of how technical the tone ought to be would be good
        a way for the user to specify the level of technical expertise of the writer 
        *and* the reader might be even better
        specifying technical expertise using a 4 or 5 tier system similar to the
        ITIL support desk tiers, plus end user (two+ levels of end user?) might be a good way to do it

        TODO: for products it'd probably be good to ensure we get information straight from the 
        manufacturer *and* from proper reviewers, if possible
        Going through a user manual if one exists would also be a good idea, at least once we have 
        gemini 1.5 access so we can use the monster context length

        TODO: we could try throwing the entire finished article into an inexpensive model and ask it to 
        extract *all* of the "truth claims" in the article. Then we could do research to attempt to 
        verify each of those claims, and if we can't verify them, we could mark them internally as 
        "unverified" and tell the model not to use them in the article. we'll have to test to see if it 
        actually follows instructions on that though. 
        Negations are a major limitation of transformers. We might actually need to come up with our own
        benchmark system for this, and then test it on a variety of models to see which one to use for 
        checking factuality.

        TODO: product reviews and roundups should probably include a scrape step specifically for grabbing 
        at least one buyers guide from a reputable source to then use as a framework and reference when 
        building the review
    -->
<p>One downside we noticed is that the fans can get quite loud, 
    especially when the switch is under heavy load. <!-- the fan isn't actually loud. this is a factual error --> 
    However, this is a minor issue that can be easily overlooked, 
    considering the overall performance of the CRS310-8G+2S+IN.</p> <!-- this entire section is just a mistaken claim? --> 
<p>Overall, the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+IN is a solid choice for 
    those in need of a reliable and efficient network switch. 
    Its combination of Gigabit Ethernet and SFP+ ports, along 
    with its compact design and user-friendly interface, make 
    it a great value for the price.</p> <!-- early conclusion that makes the article flow weirdly --> 

<h2>Compact and Lightweight Design</h2>
<p>We were impressed with the compact and lightweight design of the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in. 
    It is a perfect fit for small businesses and home offices that need a reliable and 
    efficient switch. The device is only 50 x 50 x 28 cm, and it weighs 1.22 kilograms, 
    making it easy to install and move around.</p> 
    <!-- the switch is actually kinda big for how many ports it has, but this isn't 
        actually something a user would care about --> 
<p>Despite its small size, the CRS310-8G+2S+in has a robust metal case that provides 
    excellent protection against physical damage and electromagnetic interference. 
    The device also has a fanless design, which means that it operates silently 
    and does not require any maintenance.</p> <!-- you have to be kidding me. the article contradicts itself. --> 
<p>Overall, we think that the compact and lightweight design of the 
    MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in is a significant advantage. It makes 
    the device easy to use, install, and transport, and it does not 
    compromise on performance or durability.</p> <!-- this *entire* section is worthless nonsense --> 

<h2>RouterOS Software Flexibility</h2>
<p>We were impressed with the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in's RouterOS software flexibility. 
    It offers a wide range of features and customization options that are easy to 
    navigate and configure. We were able to set up VLANs, QoS, and other advanced 
    networking features with ease. The software also allows for remote management 
    and monitoring, making it a great choice for businesses or individuals who need 
    to manage multiple networks.</p> 
    <!-- this is true, but it's not product specific. mikrotik uses one of two 
        software options for *all* of their routers and switches
        saying this in this way makes it sound like you don't actually know what 
        you're talking about

        TODO: a system to automatically enumerate all (as close to all) of the questions
        a reader will have about the subject/product and then passing that to the model
        to answer might be necessary.
    --> 
<p>One downside we noticed is that the software can be a bit overwhelming for beginners. 
    It may take some time to fully understand all the features and options available. 
    However, once you get the hang of it, the RouterOS software is a powerful tool that 
    can help you optimize and streamline your network. Overall, we highly recommend the 
    MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in for its impressive RouterOS software flexibility.</p>
    <!-- another early conclusion, plus the focus on RouterOS as something specific to this 
        product is a tell that it's AI generated/wrote by someone who shouldn't be talking about it --> 

<!-- This section REALLY should have been earlier since it's the thing a reader is actually going to care about -->
<h2>High-Speed Connectivity</h2>  
<p>We were impressed with the high-speed connectivity of the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in. <!-- dumb line --> 
    It boasts 8 Gigabit Ethernet ports and 2 SFP+ ports, <!-- is this the second or third time it's make this mistake? --> 
    allowing for lightning-fast data transfer rates.
    <!-- the routing speed is a bit slow, actually. routing performance isn't the reason people get a mikrotik, 
        and if you want major routing performance you're going to be looking for something else...but it deserves 
        a mention if you're going to say it's "lightning fast" --> 
    We tested the device with a 10Gb fiber 
    backbone and were pleased with the results. The device operates right out of the box 
    and the fan is not too loud, although we did notice that the installed aluminum ribs 
    could be larger. <!-- ...what "installed aluminum ribs?" what is it talking about? --> 
    The switch also comes with mounting holes, which is a nice touch.</p> <!-- not relevant to the section --> 
<p>We read through some reviews and found that other users also appreciated the speed of this switch. 
    One reviewer mentioned that they liked the switch and found that the fan was only loud at start-up, 
    <!-- interesting. this could be the source of the mistake about the fan (singular). 
        we should probably pass the amazon reviews into the model with a caveat about 
        them possibly being erroneous 
        
        This is the wrong section to talk about the fan. it has nothing to do with the connectivity speed.
    --> 
    
    and that it was not as bad as other people had complained about. They even switched out 
    the fan with a $15 Noctua 40mm.20mm fan and found that it was perfect.</p> 
    <!-- this is something some uber nerds do, yeah. fan size is correct, but 40mm.20mm is 
        not how you'd say it. it'd be 40mm x 20mm or something --> 
<p>Overall, we think that the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in is a great choice for those looking for 
    high-speed connectivity. Its multiple ports and lightning-fast data transfer rates make it 
    a reliable and efficient switch for any desktop setup.</p> <!-- another early conclusion --> 

<h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
<p>We were impressed with the energy efficiency of the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in. This 
    switch consumes very little power, which is great for those looking to save on 
    electricity bills. We found that it runs cool to the touch, even after prolonged 
    use, which is a testament to its energy efficiency.</p> <!-- it's actually a little power hungry for what it is --> 
<p>Not only does this switch save on power, but it also has the added benefit of being 
    environmentally friendly. We appreciate that MikroTik is making an effort to reduce 
    their carbon footprint and produce products that are sustainable.</p> 
    <!-- afaik the only reference to this anywhere in the real world is that it's CE certified. 
        that's necessary just to be legal to sell I think. there isn't anything special going on here --> 
<p>Overall, we were very pleased with the energy efficiency of the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in. 
    It's a great choice for those looking to save on power and reduce their environmental impact.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>When it comes to the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in, there are both pros 
    and cons to consider before making a purchase.</p> <!-- phenomenally generic wording. hopefully gemini 1.5 would fix this --> 
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p>One of the major advantages of this switch is its size. It's compact and easy to install, 
    making it a great option for those with limited space. Additionally, the device operates 
    out of the box, which is convenient for those who want a hassle-free setup.</p> 
    <!-- multiple (lame) items in a single pro? bad start to a pro/con list --> 
<p>Another pro of the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in is its performance. With 10Gb fiber backbone, 
    it can handle high-speed data transfer with ease. The fan is also relatively quiet, which 
    is a plus for those who don't want a noisy switch.</p> <!-- multiple (mostly lame) pros again --> 
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>While the fan is generally quiet, some users have reported that it can be loud at start-up. 
    This may be a concern for those who need a completely silent switch.</p> <!-- ok, fair --> 
<p>Another drawback of the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in is the size of the installed aluminum ribs. 
    They could be larger, which could impact the cooling performance of the device.</p>
    <!-- what in the bloody hell are they talking about. 
        is this the heatsink? it maxes out at 34 watts. 
        the heatsinks are fine. --> 
<p>Lastly, some users have reported that the setup process can be difficult. 
    <!-- this sounds like it contradicts the "easy to use out of the box" language from earlier --> 
    While the RouterOS and SwitchOS light software offer great setup possibilities, 
    they may not be user-friendly for those without networking experience.</p> 
    <!-- it's not a consumer switch, so this is accurate but the reader of this article would 
        probably be technical, so for them it's not out of the ordinary --> 
<p>Overall, the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in is a great option for those who need a compact and 
    high-performance switch. However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks 
    before making a purchase.</p>
    <!-- 
        ...another early conclusion.
        the actual conclusion should be something like "great value 2.5gb/10gb switch" 
        the compactness isn't a real selling point and it's not unusually fast for a 2.5gb/10gb switch
    --> 

<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
<p>We looked through the customer reviews for the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+in and found some 
    interesting feedback. Many customers were impressed with the device's performance, 
    with one user even stating that they were using it with a 10Gb fiber backbone and the 
    fan spinning was not loud in their configuration. Another customer mentioned that they 
    liked the switch so far and that the fan was only loud at start-up, but it wasn't as bad 
    as some people were complaining about.</p>
<p>However, there were also some criticisms. One user mentioned that the installed aluminum 
    ribs could be larger, and another expressed disappointment that the switch was not as 
    good as it could be, given the wonderful setup possibilities of RouterOS and SwitchOS 
    light.</p> <!-- ...? -->

<!-- ServeTheHome's conclusion for this switch:

Final Words
This is one of those switches that we have been waiting for or perhaps dreaming about for some time. 
New desktops, mini PCs, WiFi 6E APs, modems, and more have moved to 2.5GbE, and MikroTik has been 
stuck in the 1GbE generation. While we want to see an entire line refresh, this at least starts the process.

Clearly, though, MikroTik needs some help. Using the Marvell switch is great because it is a common 
platform the company has used for years. Unlike some cheaper switches based on Realtek unmanaged 
switch chips, MikroTik is dealing with much higher costs that limit just how inexpensive this switch 
can be. At some point, MiktoTik clearly made the decision to put small heatsinks and a fan in this 
instead of just passively cooling the switch.

The older Marvell switch chip is also not the most power-efficient, and that is fairly easy to see 
if you have been following our series. It feels like MikroTik needs to go to Marvell (or another vendor) 
and discuss next-gen switch chips. A challenge will be that most new switch chips use 64-bit Arm cores, 
so a newer chip might increase the switch chip cost and other costs, such as adding more DRAM. MikroTik 
at some point, needs to get a new platform for 2.5GbE switches as it moves up the stack. The company 
already has a 4-port 100GbE switch, the MikroTik CRS504-4XQ-IN, for $699. The CRS310-8G+2S+IN is $219 
right now, so MikroTik can already offer 10x the bandwidth for only ~3x the price. It needs things like 
a 48-port 2.5GbE switch with 100GbE, a 24-port CRS326 replacement with 2.5GbE and 25GbE, and so forth. 
That does not happen alone, MikroTik needs a switch silicon partner, and hopefully, one that can also 
offer a bit more on the hardware offloading side.

All of that, however, is feedback for a different day and where we hope the line expands in the future. 
Today, we have the MikroTik CRS310-8G+2S+IN that finally brings managed 2.5GbE networking to the desktop 
form factor and is offered by a company many have heard of before. Now that this dream is realized, we 
cannot wait to see what is next.
